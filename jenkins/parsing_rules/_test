# This file is used by the Jenkins log-parser plugin. It defines rules to identify errors and other information
# from the build log of jobs that used runtests.py for running test suites. The information is then highlighted
# and organized in a nice way in the Jenkins page for the build in question.
#
# See the log-parser documentation for details.

# Exceptions to errors:
ok /standard error/
ok /failed - flagging overall/

# Errors:
error /^__EXIT CODE: 0*[^0e]+.*$/    # Non-zero exit code
error /(?i)error/
error /(?i)fail/

# Start of individual test section:
start /^__TEST: .+$/
