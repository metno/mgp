*** QC library ***

The QC library is a simple protocol for interaction between an
application (such as Diana) and a modified quasselclient.

The Q in QC may stand for Quassel or Qt while the C may stand for
Channel, Chat, or Communication.

The example/ directory shows how to use the QC library.

See INSTALL for how to compile the library and the example.
