*** QC library (Qt Chat library) ***

* The QC library is a simple chat system based on
  QTcpSocket. Conversations are kept in a central database in order
  for clients not to lose anything if they go offline for a period.

* The example/ directory shows how to use the QC library. It contains the following apps:

  - qcapp: A Qt app controlling the local chat window. This shows how
           e.g. Diana would use the API.  The qcapp communicates with
           the local chat server (qclserver).

  - qcchat: A stand-alone chat client, typically used by
            administrators. This shows the chat window and
            communicates with a qccserver.

  - qclserver: The local chat server. This shows a chat window and
               communicates with a qccserver as well as one or more
               local qcapps. At most one instance runs on a given
               host.  A qcapp starts the instance if necessary.

  - qccserver: The central chat server. This communicates with one or
               more qclservers (and even qcchats), and stores
               conversations in a database. Exactly one instance runs.

* See INSTALL for how to compile the library and the example code.
