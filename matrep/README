=========================================================================
OVERVIEW

This directory contains MATRep, a tool for reporting manual test results
for meteorological applications. (MATRep = Meteorological Application
Test Reporter)

Test results are entered and inspected via a web application and
stored in a SQLite database file located on the same machine as the
web server.

=========================================================================
INSTALLATION ON THE SERVER MACHINE

STEP 1: Install the MATRep directory (containing this README!) under an
    arbitrary directory <MATRep dir>.


STEP 2: Install Python, SQLite, and Apache.
   ### TBD: Specify versions / dev headers


STEP 3: Initialize the database:

    $ <MATRep dir>/database/scripts/reset.py


STEP 4: Install a script named 'matrepwrapper' for executing
    matrep.py with the appropriate environment. The script
    typically looks like this on Linux (<MATRep dir> is
    /root/matrep in this example):

    #!/bin/sh
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=SOME_LIB_THAT_WE_DEPEND_ON \
    /root/matrep/scripts/matrep.py


STEP 5: Configure the Apache web server to 1) allow access to the
    <MATRep dir>/web/ directory, and 2) to allow launching
    'matrepwrapper' as a CGI script (see separate documentation
    for the web server - typically this requires changes to
    httpd.conf etc.).


STEP 6: Start the web server and (if desirable) arrange for it to be
    started automatically at boot time (on a Linux system this would
    typically mean to add some stuff under /etc/init.d/).

USAGE

--- Open the URL

    Open the top-level index.html page, located under <MATRep dir>/web/, for example:

        http://matrep.met.no:8080/matrep

    where matrep.met.no is the host address, 8080 the Apache port number,
    and matrep a symbolic link to <MATRep dir>/web/.

    Obviously, this may be configured differently on different installations.
