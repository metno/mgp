This program exits with zero (i.e. success) iff the newest file among the given input files is older
than the specified number of days.

Notes:

  - The age of the file is determined from the name, not the actual modification time (which may
    have changed since the file was created).

  - The input files are assumed to be of the form <prefix>yyyy-mm-dd-qc.db
    For example: /home/joa/metchat_backup/2015-01-24-qc.db
