TODO:

1: Fixed bug in algorithm that applies a {'S|N} OF' filter to the input polygon.
   Reproduce like this:
     a: set up a single 'S OF' filter.
     b: create a custom base polygon of size 3 where
           1) all vertices are either accepted by the filter (i.e. having latitude values lower than that of the filter), and
           2) exactly two edges intersect the filter (generating four intersection points in total)
           3) move one of the vertices that have no intersection between them and watch how these vertices sometimes are part of a result polygon
              (# result polygons = 2) and sometimes not (# result polygons = 1 -> ERROR!).

    TIP 1: The switching between the correct and incorrect state seems to correspond with the input polygon being classified as clockwise or not.
    TIP 2: If the input polygon is not automatically reversed so that it is classified as clockwise at the beginning of the algoritm, the bug appears
           in a different way: Now the entire affected result polygon is either always included in or excluded from the result depending on how the input
           polygon is visually oriented in the first place. Moving one of the two affected vertices (without changing visual orientation) then apparently has no effect.


2: Clean up code. Remove unused functions etc.
