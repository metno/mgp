TODO:

1: Clean up code. Remove unused functions etc.

2: Implement generation of result polygon by applying filters to base polygon.

3: Begin implementation of mgplib (to be used by mgpview).

4: Implement two actions for the SIGMET/AIRMET text edit:
   a: Update the filters from the text. The parse function should either return valid (with corresponding filter settings),
      or invalid (with a list of errors and their respective locations in the text - this may be used for highlighting).
   b: Update the text from the filters. This will just replace the text with a canonical expression reflecting the filters.

5: Design a control panel with the following components:

   a: A base polygon (either a pre-defined polygon, such as ENOR FIR, or a custom polygon).

   b: Eight optional conditions for removing parts of the base polygon:
      - E OF <lon>
      - W OF <lon>
      - N OF <lat>
      - S OF <lat>
      - NE OF <line>
      - NW OF <line> (where <line> is great circle between two lon/lat points)
      - SE OF <line>
      - SW OF <line>

   c: A button (named 'Apply'?) for executing the removal operations and displaying the resulting polygon(s).


      Note 1: Any subset of these eight conditions may be active. If none are active, the result is the entire base polygon.
      Note 2: The result may be empty (e.g. when specifying N OF a longitude located north of the northern tip of the base polygon).
      Note 3: The result may contain more than one polygon (if the base polygon is not a convex hull?)
      Note 4: Some combinations may be ambiguous and/or contain singularities (a base polygon containing the pole, intersects itself etc.)
      Note 5: The custom polygon should be interactively placable by hitting the Insert key while hovering the mouse etc.
              The points should later be movable by dragging the mouse.
      Note 6: Ditto for each line of the "{NE|NW|SE|SW} OF" conditions.
